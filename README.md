## What is it? 
`react-add-to-homescreen` allows you to inform the iOS users that your web app is installable on the iOS home screen. It mimics the behavior of Android's *Add to home screen* widget visible when the user visits your PWA.

## Installation
```shell
$ yarn react-add-to-homescreen
```

## Demo
You can check out the demo Progressive Web App [here](https://pills-pwa.netlify.com/). I am not the designer of this one though ðŸ˜Ž

## Usage
`react-add-to-homescreen` is designed to be as simple as possible. First import the component:
```javascript
import AddToHomescreen from 'react-add-to-homescreen';
```

Then add the component to the main component of your app:
```js
<AddToHomescreen
  onAddToHomescreenClick={this.handleAddToHomescreenClick}
/>
```

Finally, create a handler for the banner:
```js
handleAddToHomescreenClick = () => {
  alert(`
    1. Open Share menu
    2. Tap on "Add to Home Screen" button`
  );
};
```
